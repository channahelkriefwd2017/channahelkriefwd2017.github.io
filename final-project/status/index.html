<p>Lesson 3 - 22nd Nov: I found a potential client. My aunty works as an established Architect/Interior Designer. She would like me to create a site advertising her services. I would like to first discuss it with you to see if it is an appropriate idea before getting further information from my aunt.</p>

<p>Lesson 4 - 29th Nov: I prepared the Creative brief for my aunt to fill out, specifying more clearly what infromation she should supply, and emailed it to her. I will hopefully be in touch with her tonight to explain her what it is. (Tuesday pm)</p>

<p>Lesson 5 - 6th Dec: I spoke to my aunt and created an updated Creative brief. As it is a new business that she is trying to make (She works as a freelancer already, but would like now to advertise specialising something new - See other planning html.)
        I managed to get a rough idea of the business. She is going to now look at sites she likes and is going to work out her exact service. I think I will probably have to go to her in person to clarify it all as it was a bit hard to get clear on phone.</p>

<p>Lesson 6 - 13th Dec! I sent my aunt sites offering similar services to hers, and she looked at them and gave me feedback. She gave me links of websites that appealed to her. We discussed her business and how the different factors in the websites would / would not work to bring out her message. I completed the design brief for her business, having a clearer picture of the service.
    We discussed the building of her website and drew a sitemap.
