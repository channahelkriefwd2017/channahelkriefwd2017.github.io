<p>Lesson 3 - 22nd Nov: I found a potential client. My aunty works as an established Architect/Interior Designer. She would like me to create a site advertising her services. I would like to first discuss it with you to see if it is an appropriate idea before getting further information from my aunt.</p>

<p>Lesson 4 - 29th Nov: I prepared the Creative brief for my aunt to fill out, specifying more clearly what infromation she should supply, and emailed it to her. I will hopefully be in touch with her tonight to explain her what it is. (Tuesday pm)</p>

<p>Lesson 5 - 6th Dec: I spoke to my aunt and created an updated Creative brief. As it is a new business that she is trying to make (She works as a freelancer already, but would like now to advertise specialising something new - See other planning html.)
        I managed to get a rough idea of the business. She is going to now look at sites she likes and is going to work out her exact service. I think I will probably have to go to her in person to clarify it all as it was a bit hard to get clear on phone.</p>
