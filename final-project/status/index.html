<p>Lesson 3 - 22nd Nov: I found a potential client. My aunty works as an established Architect/Interior Designer. She would like me to create a site advertising her services. I would like to first discuss it with you to see if it is an appropriate idea before getting further information from my aunt.</p>

<p>Lesson 4 - 29th Nov: I prepared the Creative brief for my aunt to fill out, specifying more clearly what infromation she should supply, and emailed it to her. I will hopefully be in touch with her tonight to explain her what it is. (Tuesday pm)</p>
